Abstract expressionist painting with oil texture, materic and tactile brushstrokes. 
Zorn color palette (yellow ochre, vermilion red, ivory black, white tones). 
Background like raw ocher canvas. 
Rhythmic sequence of brushstrokes representing a musical riff: 
long sfumato horizontal strokes for sustained notes, 
pointillist dotted marks for staccato notes, 
rectangular solid blocks for power chords. 
Dynamic alternation of thick and thin strokes suggesting shuffle rhythm. 
Expressive, energetic, painterly, with visible brush textures.
