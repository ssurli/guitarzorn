guitar-driven concept into a concrete visual plan in the Zorn palette. 

Here’s a breakdown you can use as a guide for painting, focused on gesture, rhythm, and texture.

Color palette (Zorn):
- Ochre (yellow ochre)
- Vermilion (bright red-orange)
- Ivory Black
- Titanium White

Composition and gesture:
- The painting should feel like a stretched riff, with a tactile, live-in-the-studio energy. Use bold, decisive marks that read as a sequence of musical phrases.

Strokes and shapes by gesture:
- Power chords (ocra squared bold strokes)
  - Build a series of rectangular, squared-off blocks or thick, square slabs of ochre. Place them in a staggered horizontal rhythm to simulate the static root notes of a power chord.
  - Treat each block as a “beat” or “chord hit.” Let some edge be crisp, others slightly worn for texture.

- Slides (vermilion diagonal lines)
  - Implement sharp, diagonal vermilion lines moving from lower-left to upper-right (or vice versa) to imply slide up the fretboard.
  - Vary length and angle to create a sense of acceleration or release. Some lines can taper, some can break, suggesting a glissando.

- Bends (ivory black curved arcs)
  - Use curved, arcs drawn with ivory black to imply bending notes. They should arc upward or downward across the canvas, crossing over other marks like orchestrated “bends” in pitch.
  - Make some arcs thick at the center and taper at ends to mimic a bend’s physical tension.

- Legato (white smooth blends)
  - Soften transitions with smooth white blends. Build long, seamless crescents or elongated smears of titanium white to connect shapes, emulating connected, legato phrasing.
  - Use soft brushes or blending tools to reduce edge harshness where the line transitions between adjacent shapes.

Texture and surface:
- Oil on canvas style: expect visible impasto and energetic drag of the brush.
- Build layers: start with a warm, ochre ground. Introduce vermilion and ivory black in high-contrast marks, then blend with white to create a sense of air and motion.
- Let texture be audible: thick strokes for power chords, slick glazes for legato, and dry-brush or scumbled edges where lines meet.

Spatial rhythm:
- Create a left-to-right flow that imitates a guitar riff. Alternate heavy, square blocks with lighter, diagonal lines and curved arcs to simulate phrasing and dynamics.
- Allow negative space to breathe between elements to mimic rests and pauses in a riff.

Final look:
- A raw, energetic abstract composition with a warm, earthy palette.
- The overall effect should feel like you’re hearing a riff through brushstrokes: power, glide, bend, and legato all present within a single, kinetic painting.

If you’d like, I can adapt this into a step-by-step painting plan with suggested brush sizes and layering order, or generate a rough layout sketch to guide your composition.
